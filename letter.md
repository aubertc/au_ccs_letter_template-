I'm using the _Crimson Text_ font, _in italic_, **in bold**, **_in bold and italics_**.
I am not using the \textcolor{augustagrey}{\enquote{Augusta Grey}} in this document, but could if I wanted to.
This template respects the brand strategy of the University and was approved by [Augusta University's graphic designers](https://brand.augusta.edu/).
The official docx template can be found on the [DCM](https://www.augusta.edu/dcm/marketing/) website, hidden in a [box folder](https://augustauniversity.app.box.com/v/brand-templates/file/777468597182).

This document uses [markdown](https://commonmark.org/), a

>  plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.

The lists

#. can be numbered,
#. and are somehow compact.

This template relies heavily on the "komaletter" class (actually called [scrlttr2](https://ctan.org/pkg/scrlttr2)), whose 567 pages-long documentation is at the same time exhaustive, impressive, and sometimes difficult to navigate. 
The source code is, however, commented to the best of my abilities, and should help anyone willing to tweak it.

[According to wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum),

> In publishing and graphic design, ***Lorem ipsum*** is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. *Lorem ipsum* may be used as a
placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of
the text influencing the design.
>
>*Lorem ipsum* is typically a corrupted version of *De finibus bonorum et malorum*, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. The first two words themselves are a truncation of *dolorem ipsum* ("pain itself").
